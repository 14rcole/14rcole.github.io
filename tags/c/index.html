        <div class="article-style"><p>This project was more for the learning experience than anything else. I wanted to discover a bit more about how functional programming languages are implemented. So I decided to build one. Along the way I&rsquo;ve learned quite a bit about programming in C as well. This includes everything from the linking, to setting a coding style, to formatting files and the code within them such that the project can easily be scaled as it grows.</p></div>

        <div class="article-style"><p>OSTree is a tool that combines a &ldquo;git-like&rdquo; model for committing and downloading bootable fiesystem trees, along with a layer for deploying them and managing the bootloader configuration. It was designed so that package managers, system upgrade tools, etc. can use OSTree as a &ldquo;deduplicating hardlink store.&rdquo; Recently, OSTree has become popular for use with containers. However, many platforms that work with container do so in Go. This library provides a set of Go bindings for OSTree that mimic the command line as much as possible so as it make it easy for container teams to use OSTree.</p></div>

        <div class="article-style"><p>One of the libraries that makes Go so powerful is cgo, a set of bindings for calling C code from Go. This is called a Foreign Function Interface (or FFI) and despite the versatility it adds to Go, it can be a tricky library to use. To help ease new users through some of the trickier aspects of cgo, here are some general best practices.
Structs Handing C structs is one of the most common issues with cgo code.</p></div>
